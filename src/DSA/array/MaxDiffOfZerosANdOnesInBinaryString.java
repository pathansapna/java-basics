/**
 * Given a binary string s of 0's and 1's. The task is to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s (number of 0s â€” number of 1s) for a substring . In case of all 1s print -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "11000010001"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: From index 2 to index 9, there are 7
 *
 * 0s and 1 1s, so number of 0s - number
 *
 * of 1s is 6.*/
